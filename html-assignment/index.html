            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to visit my webpage. My name is <strong>Vikram</strong> and I am a 1<sup>st</sup> student here at <a href="http://www.algonquincollege.com">Algonquin College</a> enrolled in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. This is my first time back at school since 2013. I am really enjoying the program so far! This is the most comfortable I've felt in a post-secondary learning environment. I love using the <strong>Adobe Creative Cloud</strong> and I would say I am currently most skilled at using <em>Photoshop</em>. I am also very comfortable using:
            </p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Illustrator</li>
                <li>Lightroom</li>
                <li>Acrobat</li>
                <li>InDesign</li>
                <li>After Effects</li>
            </ul>        
    <p>
    Outside of school, I am very interested in tattoos and tattooing culture. I've been studying tattoos since I was a child and got my first one the day I turned 18. I have been fortunate to learn how to apply tattoos to skin, but I am much more comfortable doing my art on a computer or tablet instead. I love to apply classic tattoo culture into modern design and technology.

    I look forward to a busy two years that hopefully result in a career that I can see myself doing for the rest of my life. I know through hard work and determination, I can accomplish these goals. Thank you for taking the time to read my About Me. I would like to end this index file with a quote that I enjoy very much:
