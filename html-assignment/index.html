<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my webpage. My name is <b>Vikram</b> and I am a 1<sup>st</sup> student here at <a href="http://www.algonquincollege.com">Algonquin College</a> enrolled in the Interactive Media Design program. I am really enjoying the program so far! This is the most comfortable I've felt in a post-secondary learning environment.</p>
<br>
<p>I love using the <b>Adobe Creative Cloud</b> and I would say I am currently most skilled at using <i>Photoshop</i>. I am also very comfortable using: 
<ol>Illustrator</ol>
<ol>Lightroom</ol>
<ol>Acrobat</ol>
<ol>InDesign</ol>
<ol>After Effects</ol></p>
